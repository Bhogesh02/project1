A basic calculator web app is designed to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It typically consists of three main components: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML: This forms the structure of the calculator, creating the buttons and display screen. The layout includes buttons for digits (0-9), operations (+, -, *, /), and other functionalities like a decimal point, equal sign, and clear button.

CSS: The styling of the calculator is done using CSS. It provides the visual appearance, including the size, color, and layout of the buttons and display screen, ensuring the calculator is user-friendly and visually appealing.

JavaScript: The core functionality of the calculator is powered by JavaScript. It handles user inputs and performs calculations. When a user clicks a button, JavaScript processes the input, updates the display, and calculates the result based on the selected operations.

The calculator offers an intuitive interface where users can easily input numbers and operations, with immediate feedback shown on the display screen.
